John Nathan Albrinck Hack a Thing 1

## Who did you work with?
N/A

## What did you learn?
I learned how difficult it is to set up a project correctly and get all pieces of technology working together (see below for some of the issues I had). I had never worked with XCode or Swift before so the whole platform took a while to digest and get the hang of where commands and functionalities even are placed. I also haven't done any mobile development at all since sophomore year when I took Android Programming. I think it will be potentially helpful for my project to have had this refresher with layout, constraints, etc. 

## What didn't work?
I was working with a tutorial for a while before realizing that the instructions were from 2016 and some of the functionality was deprecated. After some more effort, I realized my XCode was also out-of-date. After finally updating my XCode, I decided to try approaching the project without an explicit tutorial and just use the Apple Dev documentation for Swift. Unfortunately, some of the basic commands I had learned in the original tutorial no longer work and I've had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do some of the basic stuff I had previously done easily by following the tutorial instructions. I also have spent a lot of time debugging the interaction between my LaunchScreen storyboard and my Main storyboard. For the life of me, I can't find a solution that makes sense for why my main board won't show up after the launch screen has finished loading.
